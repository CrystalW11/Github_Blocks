### Objectives

- Practice using the Box Model properties: `padding`, `border`, and `margin`.
- [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp]
- Practice what we've learned about `Flexbox`
- Practice using different values of `justify-content`.


Use `margin` and `padding` to adjust the spaces between the rows and use `flexbox` properties to be able to put each image in its proper place. Set the images to all have a uniform size.
